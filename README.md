# Conversational AI Model-ChatBot

This project showcases my work on building a sophisticated Conversational AI model as part of my Artificial Intelligence assignment. Leveraging the power of TensorFlow and the tflearn library, I employed Natural Language Processing and Neural Network concepts to construct an AI contextual chatbot.

How to Run?
To run the application, utilize Jupyter Notebook. Open the file in Jupyter Notebook and execute each cell. After running all cells, call the response() method with your queries. For example:

This chatbot is tailored for a Cybersecurity-focused industry. It serves as a customer care chatbot, providing insights into the services offered by the cybersecurity sector. Additionally, users can inquire about fundamental concepts in cybersecurity, such as cryptography and hashing.

By integrating this chatbot into a website using technologies like Flask, you can customize the intent file to suit your requirements, enhancing your website's performance. Automation, especially through chatbots, is becoming increasingly prevalent, and this project reflects the growing importance of AI in automating customer services.
